Notes:  
About as barebones as you can possibly get.

How to use:  
Put some .dat files in the same folder as crushit.exe  
Run crushit.exe  
Copy the resulting crush data into your car file, replacing the 2nd crush data block  

Advanced:  
Crush It loads settings from three places in the following order:  
Internal settings based on rough default values  
**default.crush** from in the same folder as the exe  
**datname.crush** from in the same folder as the exe  
This allows you to set up default settings for a batch of cars but specific settings for specific cars
